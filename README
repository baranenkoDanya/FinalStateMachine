This application should model work of the lexical and syntax analyzer. It
gets a piece of code written in C# and if the code contains any error the 
information about it is displayed on the screen(line, position, lexical or
syntax error) and the program is ready to get a new piece of code. Otherwise
it shows OK message.

The syntax analyzer should be built with an enumertive method.
